  </p><p style="margin-top:90px;">A series of many genres,
    including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the
    British school story (which includes elements of
    mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance),
    the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes
    and includes many cultural meanings and references.
    [5] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.
    [6] Other major themes in the series include
    prejudice, corruption, and madness.
    [7]The success of the books and films has allowed
    the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous
    derivative works, a travelling exhibition that
    premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in
    London that opened in 2012, a digital platform
    on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with
    new information and insight, and a pentalogy of
    spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with
    Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among
    many other developments. Most recently, themed
    attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding
    World of Harry Potter, have been built at several
    Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around
    the world.</p>
